# sm4shtools
Tools for examining, editing, and extracting data from Super Smash Brothers for Wii U/3DS

## What is this?
This is the code that generates the raw diffs and gumps that mastercore uses to show changes.

## Dependancies
* Python 2.X
* ghdiff
* pygments
* A very specific, completely undocumented file structure of files downloaded from NUS, unencrypted, extracted, and extracted again. The scripts and batch files used to do so aren't part of this repo yet, but there are clues on how things need to be structured. The focus of this project is to document how to read the files once you have them, obtaining them and getting them organized for this is an exercise better left to the reader.
